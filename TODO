150307 howto integrate external docs like lab reps, xrays etc.?
150307 put create table(s) accC, invC, payC, chP, insP, prodP etc s. queries.sql
150223 sort out encoding, thought that by now all was UTF-8 but apparently isn't
150222 patient: ck prod_queue add_prod(action=...) re new ptypes -- done?
150208 Long p_name wrapped in client.gcell but no height adaptation...  and no balance information as well...  bin this?
141221 change all db_state to use gaia if present -- done?
141220 eliminate Esc closing windows like sae..., client, patient
141127 passwd security: datefix, dbmod, gnuv
141128 table dependencies:
    accC -> prodP -- this is nonsense, as account should exist even without
    patient:
        acc_prid integer references prod{}
	acc_pid integer references patients
	try without not null?  But where to book cash when no patient?

141127 in work: client

141127 careful with that axe dbstate signal: prevent endless loops

141107 re-ck gnuv.py and other older files, there's much cramp in there
141118 implement db_state in every module using querydb from util
141120 implement dbdep_enable (from gnuv.py) in every dbdep module
141118 datefix.py et al.: dbA.connect(self.origin.db_reconnect)
141018 implement 'gaia' in ALL respective *.py files: saepat in work
141120 passwd in gnuv.py: do not save, user has to re-enter!!!
141120 ck that every new pw contains at least 8 chars and mixes alnumsign
141117 client- and server-encoding: UTF-8 inst/o LATIN9?
141014 add text search in clinical history  patient
141121 add text search over all clinical history gnuv.py
141014 implement vaccination  patient products

update lastseen on clinical entry, how if e.g. only telephone call?

Take care on postgres upgrade: if one leaves older postgres version, newer one will switch to different port (e.g. 5433 inst/o 5432).

141121
Access to ch* only for vets.  Access to prod* for staff, too.  Via postgres users or gnuvet?
