This is Pre-Alpha incomplete work.

I apologise for any inconvenience.

Prerequisites:
python2.7 or later
a fairly recent psycopg2 corresponding to your python
postgresql 8.4. or later
pyqt4 4.8 or later

Append following line to your pg_hba.conf:
local gnuvet all md5 ###### 141117 somehow doesn't seem to suffice!

If you're using a multi-user and multi-computer environment, also add:
host  gnuvet all IP-Range md5

where IP-Range is a CIDR, e.g. 192.168.0.1/16
or use a more clever solution.
