gnuvet offers a multi-user distributed system with the paradigm of being usable intuitively by everyone, mouse- as well as keyboard-fetishists, covering (almost) all possible procedures occuring within a veterinary practice from simple OTC-sales up to surgery, vaccination reminders, and providing all relevant details of information from the database.

This includes maintenance of patient history and therapies, printing of instruction labels, invoicing, statistics for patients, sales, etc.pp.
